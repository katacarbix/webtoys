	<h1>WebToys</h1>
</div>

A handy and easy-to-use collection of tools every developer needs at one point or another. It's a web-based clone of [DevToys](https://github.com/veler/DevToys) built with Next.js.

## why?

Because not everyone is a Windows user :)

## status

WebToys is in the very early stages of development and most tools are not yet implemented. I am aiming for 1:1 feature parity with DevToys eventually, wherever that's feasible.

Below is a list of things to do. Feel free to contribute if any of them appeal to you and don't be afraid to ask for help! Make sure to read through [`contributing.md`](contributing.md) first before getting in too deep.

## issues

WebToys relies on several relatively modern browser APIs for some things to work. If something seems broken, make sure you're using the latest version of Firefox or Chrome.

If it's still broken across multiple browsers then I would greatly appreciate if you opened an issue!
